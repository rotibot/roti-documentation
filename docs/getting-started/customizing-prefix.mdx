# Customizing Prefix

Are you curious about the meaning of "bot prefix" and how to use it? No need to worry, we've got you covered. This guide will provide you with everything you need to know about bot prefixes and how to customize them for R.O.T.I.

## What is prefix ?

A Discord bot prefix is a character or set of characters that are used to distinguish commands for a bot from normal chat messages. When a user wants to issue a command to a bot, they type the prefix followed by the command. For example, if the prefix is "!", a user might type "!help" to get a list of available commands from the bot.

The use of a prefix helps to avoid confusion between normal chat messages and bot commands, and ensures that the bot only responds to messages that are intended as commands.
